TODO:
- decide on a precise name (geant/geant4 and geant4.9.6/geant4-9.6)
- What licence is needed to make sure that Geant can be installed as a binary package?
- print out a notice about setting up the environmental variables (this port uses a nonstandard way to set them up)

- specify expat more precisely
- resolve dependencies for X11 (proper checks)

- Check if /opt/local/share/Geant4/Geant4-10.0.0/geant4make/geant4make.sh works

Lower priority:
- Try to move /opt/local/share/Geant4/Geant4-10.0.0/geant4make/config to a better place
- Try to get rid of one level in /opt/local/include/Geant4/Geant4.10.0/Geant4 (low priority, maybe not be needed at all)
- Fix scripts in /opt/local/libexec/Geant4/Geant4.10.0 (symlinking to them doesn't work, but on the other hand they are probably not needed)
- Carefully check different CMake configuration options
- figure out if it is possible to hardcode paths into Geant4 sources to some extent
	example: G4PenelopeOscillatorManage.cc uses
		char* path = getenv("G4LEDATA");
- Test how setting CMAKE_INSTALL_IS_NONRELOCATABLE influences different components,
  in particular GEANT4_RELATIVE_HEADER_PATH, GEANT4_INCLUDE_DIR_SETUP (cmake/Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake)

Options:
- DATAROOTDIR: Geant automatically adds /Geant4-9.6.2 (any way to prevent this?)
- INCLUDEDIR: /opt/local/include/Geant4/Geant4.9.6/Geant4 (any way to prevent double Geant4?)
- CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR: this installs binaries to a non-default location;
-     port select could be used to get the default installation, but all three scripts in bindir need patching to properly detect their location

one might want to set these variables as well (not sure if they are used at all):
- CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_MANDIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL

EXPAT
- GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_EXPAT          ON
- EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR                /usr/include
- EXPAT_LIBRARY                    /usr/lib/libexpat.dylib

ZLIB
- GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB           OFF

DONE:
- For 9.5 the following variables need to be set:
		export G4DATA=/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data
		export G4NEUTRONHPDATA=$G4DATA/G4NDL4.0
		export G4LEDATA=$G4DATA/G4EMLOW6.23
		export G4LEVELGAMMADATA=$G4DATA/PhotonEvaporation2.2
		export G4RADIOACTIVEDATA=$G4DATA/RadioactiveDecay3.4
		export G4NEUTRONXSDATA=$G4DATA/G4NEUTRONXS1.2
		export G4ABLA=$G4DATA/G4ABLA3.0
		export G4PIIDATA=$G4DATA/G4PII1.3
		export G4REALSURFACEDATA=$G4DATA/RealSurface1.0
	and probably similar for 9.6
- The following files have "wrong" permissions:
	./G4NEUTRONXS1.1:
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 macports  admin   256B 15 nov  2011 History
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 macports  admin   428B 15 nov  2011 README
	./G4NEUTRONXS1.2:
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 macports  admin   331B 15 okt  2012 History
	./G4NEUTRONXS1.3:
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 macports  admin   406B  8 feb 20:44 History
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 macports  admin   547B  8 feb 20:43 README
	./PhotonEvaporation2.2:
- proper expansion of variables (kind-of)
- Try to move /opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.10.0/Geant4-10.0.0 to a better place
	according to http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Tutorials/Packaging it should be
	/opt/local/lib/Geant4-10.0.0, so maybe one should not change path to
	/opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.10.0 after all
  Try if setting GEANT4_CMAKE_DIR (or rather: patching its definition in cmake/Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake helps) -> OK
	--- cmake/Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake
	+++ cmake/Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake
	-set(GEANT4_CMAKE_DIR ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}-${${PROJECT_NAME}_VERSION})
	+set(GEANT4_CMAKE_DIR lib/${PROJECT_NAME}-${${PROJECT_NAME}_VERSION})

  One thing than works is the following (but is an ugly hack):
  0.) remove
  1.) move /opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.9.6/Geant4-9.6.2 to /opt/local/lib/Geant4-9.6.2
      or rather all files but the symlink Darwin-clang which needs to stay for the sake of the old way of compiling programs
  2.) in Geant4Config.cmake in that directory replace
      - get_filename_component(Geant4_INCLUDE_DIR "${_thisdir}/../../../../include/Geant4/Geant4.9.6/Geant4" ABSOLUTE)
      + get_filename_component(Geant4_INCLUDE_DIR "/opt/local/include/Geant4/Geant4.9.6/Geant4" ABSOLUTE)
  3.) in Geant4LibraryDepends-release.cmake remove two lines (12&13)
	  - GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(_IMPORT_PREFIX "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}" PATH)
	  - GET_FILENAME_COMPONENT(_IMPORT_PREFIX "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}" PATH)
      (apparently each line goes one level up)

- Try to build examples and test whether they work -> seems OK
- Test if examples still work if they are manually moved to libexec -> OK
- Test if setting EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH helps move examples to a different place -> NO
- What is /opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.10.0/Geant4-10.0.0/Darwin-clang doing there? -> needed by GNUmake and needs to stay there
- geant4-config could use absolute paths instead of -L/opt/local/libexec/Geant4/Geant4.9.6/../../../lib/Geant4/Geant4.9.6 -> it does when absolute paths are specified as options
- install geant4-config via "port select"

Options:

From installation notes:
It is recommended that Windows and Mac users prefer the Geant4 Qt4 GUI. Note
also that on Mac you can only pick Qt4 OR X11/Motif interfaces. This is due
to incompatibilities between Apple's native OpenGL Framework and the OpenGL
supplied with X11 on this platform.

- opengl_x11 (or maybe just x11?)
- motif (or maybe motif_x11?)
- raytracer_x11 (or just raytracer?)

- athena/xaw is now deprecated, so I didn't include it

Bugs:
- http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1485 "aida-config --implementation" doesn't work      (no longer a problem)
- http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1486 file permissions in G4NEUTRONS1.1                (no longer a problem)
- http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1487 LC_NUMERIC confuses strtod when Qt is being used (patched in Portfile)
- http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1494 Antialiasing in Qt/OpenGL makes objects invisible
- http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1495 Issues and requests for Qt's "Save as ..."
- http://bugzilla-geant4.kek.jp/show_bug.cgi?id=1497 Qt interface: allow pasting multiple lines

Other feature requests:
- ability to change program icon (question)
- open/save files (question)
- open files with a double-click
- support for mac applications
- avoid the need to hardcode data paths
