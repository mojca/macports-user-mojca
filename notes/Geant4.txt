- What is /opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.10.0/Geant4-10.0.0/Darwin-clang doing there?
- Try to move /opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.10.0/Geant4-10.0.0 to a better place
	according to http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Tutorials/Packaging it should be
	/opt/local/lib/Geant4-10.0.0, so maybe one should not change path to
	/opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.10.0 after all
  Try if setting GEANT4_CMAKE_DIR (or rather: patching its definition in cmake/Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake helps)
	set(GEANT4_CMAKE_DIR ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}-${${PROJECT_NAME}_VERSION}) -> NO
- Try to move /opt/local/share/Geant4/Geant4-10.0.0/geant4make/config to a better place
- Check if /opt/local/share/Geant4/Geant4-10.0.0/geant4make/geant4make.sh works
- Fix scripts in /opt/local/libexec/Geant4/Geant4.10.0 (symlinking to them doesn't work)
- Try to get rid of one level in /opt/local/include/Geant4/Geant4.10.0/Geant4 (low priority)
- Try to build examples and test whether they work
- Carefully check different CMake configuration options
- geant4-config could use absolute paths instead of -L/opt/local/libexec/Geant4/Geant4.9.6/../../../lib/Geant4/Geant4.9.6
- figure out if it is possible to hardcode paths into Geant4 sources to some extent
	example: G4PenelopeOscillatorManage.cc uses
		char* path = getenv("G4LEDATA");
- Test how setting CMAKE_INSTALL_IS_NONRELOCATABLE influences different components,
  in particular GEANT4_RELATIVE_HEADER_PATH, GEANT4_INCLUDE_DIR_SETUP (cmake/Modules/Geant4BuildProjectConfig.cmake)
- Test if examples still work if they are manually moved to libexec

- Test if setting EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH helps move examples to a different place -> NO

Options:
- DATAROOTDIR: Geant automatically adds /Geant4-9.6.2 (any way to prevent this?)
- INCLUDEDIR: /opt/local/include/Geant4/Geant4.9.6/Geant4 (any way to prevent double Geant4?)
- CMake file are under /opt/local/lib/Geant4/Geant4.10.0/Geant4-9.6.2/*.cmake (there should be no Geant4/Geant4.10.0)
- CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR: this installs binaries to a non-default location;
-     port select could be used to get the default installation, but all three scripts in bindir need patching to properly detect their location

one might want to set these variables as well (not sure if they are used at all):
- CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_MANDIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
- CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL

EXPAT
- GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_EXPAT          ON
- EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR                /usr/include
- EXPAT_LIBRARY                    /usr/lib/libexpat.dylib

ZLIB
- GEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB           OFF

Additional packages that might be useful:
- gccxml-devel
	-- G4 Examples: GCCXML not found. --> P01 example disabled
	-- G4 Examples: GCCXML not found. --> P02 example disabled
- pythia (but it's version 8!)
	-- G4 Examples: Pythia6 package not found. --> decayer6 example disabled
- gdml (no such port)
	-- G4 Examples: GDML not installed --> ChargeExchangeMC example disabled
	-- G4 Examples: GDML not installed --> gdml examples disabled
	-- G4 Examples: gdml not found. --> human_phantom example with gdml disabled.
- hbook (no such port)
	-- G4 Examples: HBOOK package not found. --> g4tools/hbook analysis disabled
	-- G4 Examples: HBOOK package not found. --> g4tools/hbook analysis disabled
- hepmc (no such port)
	-- G4 Examples: HepMC package not found. --> HepMCEx01 example disabled
	-- G4 Examples: HepMC package not found. --> HepMCEx02 example disabled
	-- G4 Examples: HepMC package not found. --> MCTruth example disabled

- this is wrong:
	-- G4 Examples: AIDA package not found. --> CompositeCalorimeter example disabled
- probably not needed:
	-- G4 Examples: G3TOG4 not installed --> g3tog4 examples disabled


DONE:
- For 9.5 the following variables need to be set:
		export G4DATA=/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data
		export G4NEUTRONHPDATA=$G4DATA/G4NDL4.0
		export G4LEDATA=$G4DATA/G4EMLOW6.23
		export G4LEVELGAMMADATA=$G4DATA/PhotonEvaporation2.2
		export G4RADIOACTIVEDATA=$G4DATA/RadioactiveDecay3.4
		export G4NEUTRONXSDATA=$G4DATA/G4NEUTRONXS1.2
		export G4ABLA=$G4DATA/G4ABLA3.0
		export G4PIIDATA=$G4DATA/G4PII1.3
		export G4REALSURFACEDATA=$G4DATA/RealSurface1.0
	and probably similar for 9.6
