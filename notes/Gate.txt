Application for Mac, together with documented patches needed to create it:

TODO:
- copy license/LICENSE.txt
- copy examples & benchmarks
- figure out if there is some CMAKE variable to copy the examples automatically
- maybe put the Gate binary to libexec and create a shell script in ${prefix}/bin/Gate which sets all the necessary variables (data files) and calls the real binary afterwards
- in case of errors, Gate reports location where the file is built (that weird build path that doesn't exist any more)
- to load the material database, it would be great if Gate would look into some predefined location
  in general/src/GateTools.cc there is
    G4String GateTools::FindGateFile(const G4String& fileName)
  which checks for the environmental variable GATEHOME and may potentially load the material database and other files from there
  but for the start, try to copy the material database somewhere and set GATEHOME

Something like tho following is needed for running Gate:
	export LC_NUMERIC=C
	export G4LEDATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/G4EMLOW6.32"
	export G4LEVELGAMMADATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/PhotonEvaporation2.3"
	export G4NEUTRONHPDATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/G4NDL4.2"
	export G4NEUTRONXSDATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/G4NEUTRONXS1.2"
	export G4PIIDATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/G4PII1.3"
	export G4RADIOACTIVEDATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/RadioactiveDecay3.6"
	export G4REALSURFACEDATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/RealSurface1.0"
	export G4SAIDXSDATA="/opt/local/share/Geant4/Data/G4SAIDDATA1.1"
	/opt/local/bin/Gate $@
